## About Me
I am interested in solving the challenges in the perception of autonomous driving using computer vision, deep learning, and pattern recognition. Specifically, my research interests include semantically understanding real-world spaces and overcoming the degraded performance of vision systems under adverse conditions, such as inclement weather. Ultimately, my research aims to develop applicable perception techniques in the industries.

I obtained an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence and am pursuing PhD at Sogang University. Before joining Sogang, I spent memorable times at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS), where I obtained a B.S. in Computer Science.
