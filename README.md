## About Me
I am interested in solving the challenges in the perception of autonomous driving based on computer vision, deep learning, and pattern recognition. Specifically, my research interests includes semantically understanding real-world spaces and overcoming the degraded performance of vision systems under adverse conditions such as inclement weather. Ultimately, my research aims to develop the appliable perception techniques in the industries.

I obtained M.S. in Artificial Intelligence and pursuing PhD at Sogang University. Before joining Sogang, I spent memorable times at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS), where I obtained a B.S. in Computer Science.
