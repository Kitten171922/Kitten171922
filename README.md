## About Me
I am interested in solving the challenges in the perception of autonomous driving based on computer vision, deep learning, and pattern recognition. Specifically, my research interests includes semantically understanding real-world spaces and overcoming the degraded performance of vision systems under adverse conditions such as inclement weather.

## Research Interest
- Computer Vision
- 2D/3D Semantic Segmentation
- Semantic-SLAM
- Pattern Recognition
